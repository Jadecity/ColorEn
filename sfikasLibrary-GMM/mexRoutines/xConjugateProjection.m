% Project Kx1 vector weights .* x to hyperplane 
% defined by weights'*y = 1, subject 
% to the constraint sum(y) = 1, y >= 0.
% The objective function is supposed to be of the form
%       x'Ax + bx + const.
% 
% Notes: 1. If weights = ones(1,K), then the result should
%           coincide to K.Blekas' BIDProjection(x).
% Notes: 2. In the CVPR08 submission, the objective function was
%           in fact of the form x'Ax + bx + clogx + const.
%           In BLEKAS05, the objective function function was
%           x'x + bx + clogx + const.
