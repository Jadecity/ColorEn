function [med indMed minDist] = medoid(X)
% [med indMed minDist] = medoid(X)
%
% Computes the medoid out of a set of vectors.
% The medoid itself is returned as "med" and its index as "indMed".
%
% The Medoid is defined the vector that has the least total
% distance "minDist" (sum of distances) from all the other vectors in the
% said set. So the difference from the set Mean is effectively
% that the medoid is necessarily a member of the set; also,
% the mean will coincide with the medoid, should the mean be
% a member of the set.
%
% The columns of the input matrix X are the vectors in question,
% so X is size JxN where J are the number of our vector variates
% and N and is the number of vectors.
