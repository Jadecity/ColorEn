function X = randGmm(N, w, m, U, V)

% Use as X = randgmm(N, w, m, U)
% or     X = randgmm(N, w, m, [], V)
% 
% Returns a Nxd matrix, where each column is a sample from
% a mixture of multivariate normals. The parameters of the mixture are
% w     Kx1 kernel weight vector.
% m     dxK matrix of means (each mean is a column)
% U     dxdxK matrix of upper triangular Cholesky factors of the
%       covariance matrices.
% V     dxdxK matrix of covariance matrices.
%
% Requires "lightspeed" library.
